# FlatSpark

FlatSpark is a Spark Skin for Flex 4. We don't think Flex applications should look like the same boring outdated Flex skin, so we wanted to make a skin that feels more like it was made for the new web. There are still a bunch of components missing, but we wanted to release this version so we can get a spark on the community (no pun intended).
It is inspired by the beautiful work done by [DesignModo](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/).

Here's where we got so far:
