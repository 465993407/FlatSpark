# FlatSpark

FlatSpark is a Spark Skin for Flex 4. We don't think Flex applications should look like the same boring outdated Flex skin, so we wanted to make a skin that feels more like it was made for the new web. There are still a bunch of components missing, but we wanted to release this version so we can get a spark on the community (no pun intended).
It is inspired by the beautiful work done by [DesignModo](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/).

# FLATSPARK IS NOW OFFICIALLY PART OF THE APACHE FLEX FLAMEWORK
FlatSpark was donated to Apache and it is now officially a part of the Flex Framework, starting in Flex 4.14. With that in mind, **this project is no longer maintained here**, if you want to watch its development and contribute, you should now follow the Flex SDK official repository [here](https://github.com/apache/flex-sdk/tree/develop/frameworks/projects/flatspark).

This repository won't receive any changes and all its information is now considered outdated. For updated information on how to use FlatSpark, see Apache's official wiki link [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLEX/Using+FlatSpark+skins)
